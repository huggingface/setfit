# Installation

Before you start, you'll need to setup your environment and install the appropriate packages. 🤗 SetFit is tested on **Python 3.8+**.

## pip

The most straightforward way to install 🤗 Datasets is with pip:

```bash
pip install setfit
```

If you have a CUDA-capable graphics card, then it is recommended to [install `torch` with CUDA support](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to train and performing inference much more quickly:

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

## Installing from source

Building 🤗 SetFit from source lets you make changes to the code base. To install from the source, clone the repository and install 🤗 SetFit in [editable mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html) with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/setfit.git
cd setfit
pip install -e .
```

If you just want the bleeding-edge version without making any changes of your own, then install from source by running:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/setfit.git
```

## Conda

If conda is your package management system of choice, then you can install 🤗 SetFit like so:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge setfit
```
