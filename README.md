# SetFit - Efficient Few-shot Learning with Sentence Transformers

SetFit is an efficient and prompt-free framework for few-shot fine-tuning of [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net/). It achieves high accuracy with little labeled data - for instance, with only 8 labeled examples per class on the Customer Reviews sentiment dataset, SetFit is competitive with fine-tuning RoBERTa Large on the full training set of 3k examples 🤯!


Compared to other few-shot learning methods, SetFit has several unique features:

* 🗣 **No prompts or verbalisers:** Current techniques for few-shot fine-tuning require handcrafted prompts or verbalisers to convert examples into a format that's suitable for the underlying language model. SetFit dispenses with prompts altogether by generating rich embeddings directly from text examples.
* 🏎 **Fast to train:** SetFit doesn't require large-scale models like T0 or GPT-3 to achieve high accuracy. As a result, it is typically an order of magnitude (or more) faster to train and run inference with.
* 🌎 **Multilingual support**: SetFit can be used with any [Sentence Transformer](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers&sort=downloads) on the Hub, which means you can classify text in multiple languages by simply fine-tuning a multilingual checkpoint.

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install `setfit` by running:

```bash
python -m pip install setfit
```

### Training a SetFit model

`setfit` is integrated with the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) and provides two main classes:

* `SetFitModel`: a wrapper that combines a pretrained body from `sentence_transformers` and a classification head from `scikit-learn`
* `SetFitTrainer`: a helper class that wraps the fine-tuning process of SetFit.

Here is an end-to-end example:


```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from sentence_transformers.losses import CosineSimilarityLoss

from setfit import SetFitModel, SetFitTrainer


# Load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub
dataset = load_dataset("sst2")

# Simulate the few-shot regime by sampling 8 examples per class
num_classes = 2
train_dataset = dataset["train"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(8 * num_classes))
eval_dataset = dataset["validation"]

# Load a SetFit model from Hub
model = SetFitModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2")

# Create trainer
trainer = SetFitTrainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    loss_class=CosineSimilarityLoss,
    batch_size=16,
    num_iterations=20, # The number of text pairs to generate for contrastive learning
    column_mapping={"sentence": "text", "label": "label"} # Map dataset columns to text/label expected by trainer
)

# Train and evaluate
trainer.train()
metrics = trainer.evaluate()

# Push model to the Hub
trainer.push_to_hub("my-awesome-setfit-model")

# Download from Hub and run inference
model = SetFitModel.from_pretrained("lewtun/my-awesome-setfit-model")
# Run inference
preds = model(["i loved the spiderman movie!", "pineapple on pizza is the worst 🤮"]) 
```

## Reproducing the results from the paper

We provide scripts to reproduce the results for SetFit and various baselines presented in Table 2 of our paper. Check out the setup and training instructions in the `scripts/` directory.

## Developer installation

To run the code in this project, first create a Python virtual environment using e.g. Conda:

```bash
conda create -n setfit python=3.9 && conda activate setfit
```

Then install the base requirements with:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

This will install `datasets` and packages like `black` and `isort` that we use to ensure consistent code formatting.

### Formatting your code

We use `black` and `isort` to ensure consistent code formatting. After following the installation steps, you can check your code locally by running:

```
make style && make quality
```
