# SetFit

Official repository for SetFit.

## Getting started

[ADD QUICKSTART]

## Developer installation

To run the code in this project, first create a Python virtual environment using e.g. Conda:

```bash
conda create -n setfit python=3.9 && conda activate setfit
```

Then install the base requirements with:

```bash
python -m pip install '.[dev]'
```

This will install `datasets` and packages like `black` and `isort` that we use to ensure consistent code formatting. Next, go to one of the dedicated baseline directories and install the extra dependencies, e.g.

```bash
cd scripts/setfit
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Formatting your code

We use `black` and `isort` to ensure consistent code formatting. After following the installation steps, you can check your code locally by running:

```
make style && make quality
```
